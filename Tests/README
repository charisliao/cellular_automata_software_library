## Directory Path: the-golden-gopher/Tests
#

This is the directory where all tests for the different C++ implementations of the CA model library are located. 

This directory contains source C++ programs with a main function 
inside them (i.e. they can be executed)

Files: 
    - README: This file which contains a general description of the project and the directory structure

    - Makefile: Automation script for compiling the library and examples, and cleaning all the subdirectories

    - sample_test.cpp: This is a test file that tests the functionality of the library

    - input_values_test.cpp: This is a test file that tests the functionality of the CellularAutomata
    class setup methods 

    - init_cond_test.cpp: This is a test file that tests the functionality of the init_cond method that 
    initializes the initial conditions of the CA model as well as the init_cond_rewrite method that
    initializes another condition of the CA model 

## Instructions: 
- To run the sample test use the command: `make sample_test` in the Tests/ directory
- To run the input values test use the command: `make input_values_test` in the Tests/ directory
- To run the init cond test use the command: `make init_cond_test` in the Tests/ directory

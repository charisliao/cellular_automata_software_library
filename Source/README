This subdirectory contains the C++ implementations of the CA model library. The library is written in C++ and is designed to be used in conjunction with jupyter notebook locating in the Utils/Plots/ directory. 

Tests of these functionalities are located in the Tests/ directory.

There is an example model that uses the cellular automata library in the Examples/ directory.

Files: 
    - README: This file which contains a general description of the project and the directory     structure

    - Makefile: Automation script for compiling the library, and cleaning all the files made by the Makefile

Subdirectories:
    - CA_model: This subdirectory contains the source code for the CA model library.

## Instructions: 
- To compile the source code, run the following command in the Source/ directory:
```make all```

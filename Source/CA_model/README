This is the main directory which contains the source code for the cellular automata library. The library is written in C++ and is designed to be used in conjunction with jupyter notebook locating in the Utils/Plots/ directory. There is an example model that uses the cellular automata library in the Examples/ directory.

Object files made using the Makefile in this subdirectory will be located in the Libdir/ subdirectory
after compilation.

Files: 
    - README: This file which contains a general description of the project and the directory structure

    - Makefile: Automation script for compiling the library and examples, and cleaning all the subdirectories

    - ca_model_setup.cpp: This is the source code for the setup methods for the CA model class

    - ca_model_steps.cpp: This is the source code for the update step method for the CA model class

    - ca_model_vis.cpp: This is the source code for the visualization methods for the CA model class

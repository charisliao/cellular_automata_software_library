This is the main directory which contains the source code for the cellular automata library. The library is written in C++ and is designed to be used in conjunction with jupyter notebook locating in the Utils/Plots/ directory. There is an example model that uses the cellular automata library in the Examples/ directory.

Object files made using the Makefile in this subdirectory will be located in the Libdir/ subdirectory
after compilation.

This directory contains all executable files compiled by the Makefiles in this project.
There is no Makefile in this directory because nothing is built here.

C++ Programs under the Examples and Tests subdirectories will create executable files that
are stored in this directory.

To run them, type `./<executable file name>` in the terminal such as `./sample_test`.

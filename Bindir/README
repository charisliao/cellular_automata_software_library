This directory contains all executable files compiled by the Makefiles in this project.

C++ Programs under the Examples and Tests subdirectories will create executable files that are stored in this directory.

To run them, navigate to this directory and run the corresponding Makefile commands. The following commands are available:
- make all: compiles all the executable files
- make clean: removes all the executable files
- make battery_model : compiles the executable file for the battery model example
- make sample_test: compiles the sample unit test
- make init_cond_test: compiles the unit test for the initialization conditions
- make input_values_test: compiles the unit test for the input values

Files: 
- battery_model: executable file for the battery model example
- init_cond_test: executable file for the unit test for the initialization conditions
- input_values_test: executable file for the unit test for the input values
- sample_test: executable file for the sample unit test

--------------------------------------------------------
To run your own executable file, follow the following steps:
1. Replace the makefile target with the name of your executable file. For instance `battery_model: battery_model` becomes `my_executable: my_executable`. The command to compile your executable file is now `./my_executable`. This will allow to use the makefile commands to compile and run your executable file.
2. Add the name of your executable file to the list of files to be cleaned
3. Add the name of your executable file to the list of files to be compiled
4. Move the text file containing the output of your program to the Utils/Plots/Data directory
using the command `mv <filename> ../Utils/Plots/Data/`

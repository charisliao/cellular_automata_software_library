This directory contains object code files and libraries for the CA model library. 
There is no Makefile in this directory because nothing is built here.

C++ programs under the ../Source and ../Utils subdirectories will create object code files that
are stored in this directory.

Files:
- CA_model.o: object code file for the CA model library
- randseed.o : object code file for the random number generator

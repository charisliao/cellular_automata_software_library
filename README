This is the main directory which contains the source code for the cellular automata library. The library is written in C++ and is designed to be used in conjunction with jupyter notebook locating in the Utils/Plots/ directory. There is an example model that uses the cellular automata library in the Examples/ directory. 

The directory structure is as follows:
Root Directory contents:

    - README.md: This file which contains a general description of the project and the directory structure

    - Makefile: Global automation script for compiling the library and examples, and cleaning all the subdirectories


Subdirectories: 

    - Bindir/ : This directory contains all the compiled executable programs

    - Libdir/ : This directory contains all the compiled object files (.o files) 

    - Include/ : This directory contains all the header files (.h files) for the library

    - Source/ : This directory contains all the source code for the cellular automata library 
                implemented in C++
    
    - Examples/ : This directory contains the example model that uses the cellular automata library

    - Utils/ : This directory contains the plotting tools for visualizing the results of the CA models

    - Tests/ : This directory contains the unit tests used to test the functionalities of the library
